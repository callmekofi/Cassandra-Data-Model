# Data-Model (Cassandra)

Introduction: This assignment aims to construct a NoSql database using Cassandra to examine songs and user activity data collected by Sparkify. This uses models to design and create tables to optimise queries on datasets made available by Sparkify as log data and song data in JSON formats. At the end of this project, the Sparkify analysis team can retrieve results based on queries on what songs its users are listening to.
